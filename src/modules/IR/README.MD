# IR Modules

## DB's
- Reasearch by myself, sources commented somewhere on top of the files
- Some of codes are untested as i have 2 LG TV's i don't have much devices to test, i need to go to some shop to test them

## Modules
- Modules mostly written by AI as i didn't want to waste time reaserching protocols

1. nec.py - nec protocol - Tested and working
2. sony.py - sony's IR protocol - Didn't test.
